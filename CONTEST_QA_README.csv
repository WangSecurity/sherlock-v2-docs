On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?,"e.g. Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, or any EVM-compatible network",1
"If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?","Please specify the token standards, whether you want to use only certain implementations or any tokens, and what weird traits can these tokens have. Also, feel free to provide examples of the tokens you intend to use. Please make sure they do not exhibit any [weird traits](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20).",2
"Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?","This question applies to all access-restricted functions in the codebase, including out-of-scope contracts. Access-restricted functions are only callable by a protocol role (Owner, Keeper, FeeManager, or any custom role specified in the codebase). 

It's possible to answer ""No."" and not put any limitations on possible values.

Important: If you don't provide an answer for a specific variable, or answer ""No"" Watsons will not report issues based on specific values of variables controlled by a protocol role. However, Watson will report them if the issue is possible with any possible value. 

It's possible to link to a deployment script. The values in that script will be taken into account as specific values.

Example answer: 
- Sherlock.sol::yieldStrategyDeposit(uint256 _amount) 
    - `_amount` = Between `100e6` and `10_000e6` ",3
"Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in protocols you integrate with, including restrictions on array lengths?","Same as above, except this applies to access-restricted functions of protocols you integrate with.

It's common to answer ""No.""

Example answer:
- AaveV3 - PoolConfigurator.sol::function setSupplyCap(address asset, uint256 newSupplyCap)
    - `asset` = USDC
    - `newSupplyCap` = Between `1e6` and `100_000e6`",4
"For permissioned functions, please list all checks and requirements that will be made before calling the function.","Please be precise about your answer and list all, even obvious checks. If these checks are insufficient for the safe functioning of the system, we will raise it as an issue for you. Please provide any situations in which functions will not be used.",5
Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?,"Please divide the EIPs you implement into two categories: strictly compliant and optionally compliant. Any discrepancies from the specification will be raised if the implementation is to be strictly compliant. In the case of optionally compliant implementations, we won't raise an issue unless it will have implications in the usage of the contracts beyond being non-compliant.",6
"Are there any off-chain mechanisms or off-chain procedures for the protocol (keeper bots, arbitrage bots, etc.)?",Please also describe all acceptable and unacceptable arbitrage strategies based on the protocol.,7
Are there any hardcoded values that you intend to change before (some) deployments?,,8
"If the codebase is to be deployed on an L2, what should be the behavior of the protocol in case of sequencer issues (if applicable)? Should Sherlock assume that the Sequencer won't misbehave, including going offline?",,9
"What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has low/unknown impact?","For example, the invariant is the amount of the underlying tokens must equal the amount of vault tokens. Even if breaking this invariant has low impact, it will be assigned Medium severity.",10
Please discuss any design choices you made.,"For example: ""We chose to ignore fees in some calculations because they unnecessarily overcomplicated formulas, but didn't have practically any impact on the final result. But, if this approximation may cause a serious loss of funds, it may be a valid finding.""",11
Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue.,"Acceptable risks from issues from non-Sherlock audits must be described explicitly; please do not put links in this section. Please write ""Any risk is acceptable"" if you are okay with any risks, or qualify the restrictions, such as ""Any risk is acceptable unless it's High severity"".",12
We will report issues where the core protocol functionality is inaccessible for at least 7 days. Would you like to override this value?,"The default value is suitable for most contests, and in case such a DoS would cause some more serious implications, the issue will be raised nevertheless (for example, if there would be a 2-day window for executing some critical action, but a 3-day DoS is possible).",13
Please provide links to previous audits (if any).,"Please note that listing the audits here only provides context to Watsons and doesn't invalidate findings acknowledged in these audits, unless the past audit was Sherlock's, the issue was marked ""Won't fix"" and this is an Update Contest of that codebase.",14
Please list any relevant protocol resources.,"Feel free to link the docs, whitepaper, and the website for Watsons to gather context on the audit.",15
Additional audit information.,"If you'd like to modify Sherlock's rules or specify what areas would you like Watsons to look into, this is a perfect place to do so.
In case you forked any contracts, please provide a diff from the original ones. You can also provide a diff of the contracts after your last audit(s). This will direct Watsons' focus on the least battle-tested parts.",16
