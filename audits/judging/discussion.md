# Issue Discussions

**Important:** Be sure to include all relevant details in your comment to ensure clarity and completeness.

### Phase 1: Community Judging

During this phase:
- All judges can comment without restrictions.
- Judges without a signal score can only comment on their own issues (as authors).

### Phases 2, 3, and 4

When the Lead Judge and Sherlock Judge are involved, the following rules apply:
- Each judge or author is limited to **one comment per issue** in the discussion section. Additional comments may be granted by the Lead Judge or Sherlock Judge.
- Judges must have at least **100 signal** to comment on issues submitted by third parties.

### Escalations

In Phase 3 (lasting 24 hours), judges can escalate issues by leaving a comment in the discussion. If no escalation occurs, the discussion closes at the start of Phase 4.

Escalations require a fixed **signal cost**, which is non-refundable. This cost discourages unnecessary escalations by removing the incentive to escalate freely.
