# Lead Judge

As Lead Judge, your role is to assess and make decisions on a subset of complex or controversial issues, typically between 1% and 10% of all cases. Your focus will be on issues that are challenging to judge and have been marked as controversial. You are expected to:

1. Evaluate Issues: Carefully analyze each controversial/escalated issue, balancing the judging guidelines and your own subjective common sense for your decisions. Use clear, reasoned explanations for why each judgment was made, especially when an issue requires subjective interpretation or a nuanced approach.

2. Use Judgement & Reasoning: While adhering to the guidelines is important, you can override them based on common-sense reasoning when you find it justified. Your decisions should reflect a balanced understanding of the context and potential impacts of each issue.

3. Collaborate as Needed: The Sherlock team is available to discuss decisions and provide input. You are encouraged to consult them for brainstorming or clarification, though the individual judgments remain with you.

4. Ensure Judgement Integrity: The Sherlock team will respect your final decisions unless a strong indication of error is identified.
