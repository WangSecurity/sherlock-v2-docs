***

* Historical decisions are no longer considered sources of truth. They may guide Watsons, but judgments should always be based on rules as they are and mistakes should not be repeated. Private messages are not sources of truth.
* Updated the [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention") and [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention") sections to better explain what high and medium severity issues are. Repealed the [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention") description.
* Added an exception to the hierarchy of truth for cases where blatant mistakes in a higher source of truth were made.
* Specified opportunity loss and design choices to be out of scope.
* Updated the [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention") section to require the PoC in more cases and ensure that Watsons need to discover the limitations and constraints of the issue being triggered.
* Rephrased the "Future issues" rule to remove ambiguity.
* Changed words in several places to ensure ease of understanding. Typo fixes.
