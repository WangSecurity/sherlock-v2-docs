# Judging Process

### Phase 1: Community Judging
> Why? Reduces workload for Lead Judge

- Happens right after the audit contest ends
- Lasts a fixed number of days (# of issues / 100) days (for example 500 issues would be 5 days), with a minimum of 2 days.
- Dedicated Judge signups give some degree of certainty that all issues will be de-duplicated and initially judged by the end of this period

The dedicated judges need to judge all issues during the fixed number of days. See [Dedicated Judge](audits/real-time-judging/dedicated-judge.md) for more details.

### Phase 2: Lead Judge
> Why? If we go straight to preliminary results, security researchers may get frustrated by the inaccurate judging done by the community

- Lead Judge will know his start date as soon as the contest ends (if 500 issues then he starts 5 days after the contest ends)
- Lead Judge gets (# of issues / 200) days to do this preliminary judging, with a minimum of 2 days. (so 500 issues would round up to 3 days)
- Lead Judge only needs to focus on the controversial issues during this phase
- Lead Judge must provide an explanation for every judgment
- Checkpoint: Preliminary Results Announced

The lead judge may begin judging before the official start date.

### Phase 3: Escalation Period
- After the preliminary results are announced, security researchers get 24 hours to review the judgments and comment on judgments they disagree with

### Phase 4: Final Lead Judge Judgments
- Lead Judge gets (# of controversial issues / 20) days to complete Phase 4, with a minimum of 2 days.
- Lead Judge will review all controversial issues (new ones from the Escalation Period and old ones that he already judged)
- Lead Judge will make final decisions on all controversial issues
- Checkpoint: Final Results Announced

The Sherlock Judge will closely monitor the decisions during Phase 4, be available for any questions, ask questions if something is unclear, and only overturn a decision if itâ€™s clearly wrong.
