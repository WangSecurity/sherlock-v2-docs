Repealed the [#ii.-criteria-for-issue-severity](./#ii.-criteria-for-issue-severity "mention") description.
* Added an exception to the hierarchy of truth for cases where blatant mistakes in a higher source of truth were made.
* Specified opportunity loss and design choices to be out of scope.
* Updated the [Requirements](./#vi.-requirements "mention") section to require the PoC in more cases and ensure that Watsons need to discover the limitations and constraints of the issue being triggered.
* Rephrased the "Future issues" rule to remove ambiguity.
* Changed words in several places to ensure ease of understanding. Typo fixes.
